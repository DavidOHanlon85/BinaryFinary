<h2>Part 1 - Basic</h2>

Given the following array that represents an 8 bit (non signed) binary number 

boolean[] eightBitArray = { true, false, false, true, false, true, false, true };

Write a method that will output the array as a 0 or 1 based number representation; where true =1 and false = 0 i.e. 

1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1

<h2>Part 2 - Advanced</h2>

Write a method that'll output the decimal value of the 8 bit number in the array.
